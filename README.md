## Discription

Hey! Nice to see you here. I would like to show you my project named To Do List. It allows you to: 
  1. Write your tasks to do
  2. Mark which tasks are done
  3. Remove tasks which are complete

  I hope you enjoy.


## About 

This is my second project and first mostly on javascript. I am glad that I have made another step to my programist career.
